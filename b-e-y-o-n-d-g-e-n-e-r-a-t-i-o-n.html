              When Jason M. Allen, the winner of the competition, posted his
              three art entries online, it garnered a lot of protests from
              artists. They seem to claim that he cheated, that he was not an
              artist as it was made by a robot, likening it to a “Banana taped
              to a wall”. Allen disagrees, saying that he put a lot of work and
              effort into his art and that it wasn’t an easy process at all,
              claiming to put in over 80 hours of work into it, even needing to
              edit the final drafts before he could submit them as entries
              (Metz, 2022).

              Would this mean there would be an emergence of different kinds of
              artists? One that is neither traditional nor digital but something
              else entirely? An artist who uses AI-generated images from prompts
              and others to create artwork—an AI artist? A prompt engineer?

              But are they really artists if they didn’t do the heavy lifting
              that the AI is doing? There really isn’t such a term as “AI
              artists” because these people aren’t considered artists at all. If
              they aren’t artists, should their “works” be considered art? Would
              AI-generated art create an entirely new category in the art world?

              Another article featured an artist who created a children’s book
              through the use of artificial intelligence tools, ChatGPT,
              MidJourney, and others. It garnered a bit of backlash from people,
              saying that he was plagiarizing, questioning his expertise in
              writing children’s books, and even claiming that the whole book
              was not his work as it was all made by an AI. At the end of the
              article, the artist in question did acknowledge the concerns that
              various people had about the tools he used to create his work
              (Endicott, 2022).

              Apart from the implication of AI supposedly competing with human
              artists and the perceived threat to the job security of artists,
              there is also the ethical sphere that we may have to contend with.
              An example that garnered the concern of many was the incident
              wherein the style of the late artist Kim Jung Gi, well known for
              his photographic memory and freehand-inked works, was fed into an
              AI Image Generator to produce works that imitate Kim Jung Gi’s
              style. The backlash could be attributed to how untimely or
              distasteful the act was as the famous artist had only recently
              passed away when the AI-generated images were released. However,
              many artists, big or small, fear their works are being
              unceremoniously referenced by AI without their permission, which
              they view as “
            </span>
            <a href="#copyright" class="b-e-y-o-n-d-g-e-n-e-r-a-t-i-o-n-link09">

            <br />
            <span>
              This point could be counter-argued that a human artist similarly
              references others too when creating an illustration/image, as
              renowned American filmmaker Jim Jarmusch says that “Nothing is
              original.” Adam Duff, better known as LUCIDPIXUL, argues that
              while the use of AI in itself is harmless, it is said that only
              when AI image generation is used to “hijack” the identity of an
              artist is it when it truly “crosses the line” (Duff, 2022).

          >
            <span>
              Duff insists that while an artist cannot claim or legally enforce
              an art style, the style of an artist is tied to their own
              identity. When an artist admires a master he/she/they would
              imitate or study the master’s work, as it made an impression on
              the artist. Can we say that the artist is engaging in unethical
              behavior? If we abide by Duff’s statement then the answer would be
              no (Duff, 2022).This back and forth between the pros and the
              nay-sayers can go on for eternity, as such the ethical concern
              will be a pressing matter while a consensus is still being
              debated.

              , data that is curated by the developers of an AI tool to make a
              dataset—sometimes including images that you post online—are used
              as training data to for the AI Image Generator to create entirely
              new images from scratch, i.e., a novel image.

            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              In short, AI Image Generators do not steal existing artworks but
              instead, use them as inspiration in the way that a human artist
              would. At the end of the day, AI is supposed to mimic human
              behavior.

            <br />
            <span>
              However, cases of art theft could technically occur if a dataset
              that is fed onto an AI Image Generator contains copyrighted
              images. For example, Plunkett (2022) discussed a situation wherein
              an AI Image Generator is fed with copyrighted images that have
              their watermarks and signatures erased. Cases like this argue for
              the need for regulation of AI Image Generation to prevent further
              damage both to its users and AI as a whole.

              Copyright protection only applies to human authors. By the letter
              of the law, one cannot claim copyright protection for an AI
              because the AI is a non-human entity and is not recognized as a
              legal person. Therefore, the question then becomes should the
              copyright extend to the user who “created” the artwork through the
              use of an AI image generator? But then again, who gets credited
              for the artwork?

            <br />
            <span>
              Epstein et al. (2020) tackled this set of questions and their
              answer was “it’s complicated”. The results of the research were
              not straightforward and there was no solid designation of who
              owned the art or not but a “hierarchy of accountability” was
              provided.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              At the top of the hierarchy is the artist (person who takes
              inspiration/references/samples from the crowd and creates art
              using the generative AI software), then followed by the
              technologist (person who created the software), and finally the
              crowd (people who create the inspiration/references/samples that
              the artist uses).

              It would depend on the country where the art was created as each

              AI-generated work, however, has a tendency to not be protected by
              copyright due to a present lack of regulations (as with all
              new/breakthrough technologies). The two solutions offered to this
              problem are to treat AI as either Work for hire or, if that option

              Art theft and invasive data gathering are certainly ethically
              concerning when it comes to AI Image Generation, but none is more
              concerning and more pressing than the fact that these images can
              be sexualized. It does not even have to be with open-source apps
              like Stable Diffusion. Lensa’s AI was caught generating NSFW
              content with images from users who were unaware of their
              likenesses being used in such works (Tangalakis-Lippert, 2022). It
              even came to a point where One user’s childhood photos were used
              in creating such content (Snow, 2022).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              While there are filters and restrictions for such images to be
              generated, it does not seem to be heavily enforced or regulated
              which is concerning as such things could become issues that the
              media could exaggerate when left unchecked (Vincent, 2022)— which
              would have an impact on the company/brand/creator of the
              application and possibly, in general, the creative freedom of
              users online.

                The ethical ramifications of AI-generated images are concerning
                and their potential to change society, its laws, and bylaws
                around the internet, and Netiquette is huge. Jiang (2022)
                presented an article wherein an art thief “captured” an ongoing
                Livestream of an artist’s painting, then proceeded to use an AI
                Image Generator to finish the work before the artist did so.

              <br />
              <span>
                A repeat of a similar situation could be an influential factor
                for artists to eventually avoid posting WIPs (work-in-progress
                art) or streaming their work in the future. Thankfully, the
                thief did not get away with it, but it has still set a precedent
                in the art world.

              <br />
              <span>
                • Streaming one’s work is one of the few ways an artist can
                interact with their audience and patrons. Changing Livestreaming
                behavior could effectively remove this line of communication
                between artist and audience.

              <br />
              <span>
                • A start of a movement consisting of artists encouraging other
                artists to archive their art streams if they have any (i.e.,
                change in artistic process). If this becomes a demand in the
                future, new applications or social media websites—that are
                dedicated to recording and archiving artwork—could pop up.

              The following section will speculate the future of development in
              Artificial Intelligence.

            <span>
              For future enterprise and consumer applications, there are at
              least three possible ways in which AI tools will be embedded. It
              can be either through standalone AI products that work under a
              cloud-processing model (similar to Adobe Creative Cloud) or as
              individual AI tools implemented as features into already popular
              image/video processing tools (such as what AI-enabled features
              Blender is fast incorporating into its menu options). A third
              option, which is already happening but will become more
              sophisticated, is for AI platforms to allow AI-enhanced browsers
              (ergo, the wider public) to access its functions.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Still beyond these “just-around-the-corner” tools, visionary AI
              developers are also aiming for AI-powered operating systems, and
              AI-powered features as well within application suites that are not
              specifically just for image/video processing but for a wider range
              of user needs (e.g. imagine an AI-powered Microsoft Office or
              AI-powered Google Maps/Google Earth).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              With these predictions, further questions can be asked such as
              which AI startups can be the “disruptors?” Will OpenAI,
              forerunners in the explosive race among AI Image Generators,
              remain as the “to-be disrupted?” Until when before another
              disruptive innovation will heavily affect AI (similar to the
              Internet giving AI developers more accessible and larger
              datasets)? Out of all these questions, perhaps the most important
              one is how will AI tools further develop in terms of acquiring
              more functionalities.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              To answer the last question, it is imperative to take note of a
              September 2022 discussion between the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman,
              with Hoffman Reid.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              The 2022 discussion of Reid and Altman begins with the OpenAI CEO
              describing AI as a “genuine technological revolution” consisting
              of tools to “significantly augment human ideas and workflows on an
              everyday basis.” Altman proceeded to describe the successful AI
              models as a “foundational platform” from which numerous
              advancements would be made “across all industries [followed by] an
              explosion of new companies.”
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              In other words, Altman is referring to AI’s crucial role across
              the board, in all kinds of derivative technologies and
              applications (Reid &amp; Altman, 2022 Sep 13). But certainly the
              sudden mushrooming of AI art generators just this year (2022), and
              the enthusiastic response of millions of users (not just artists)
              getting on board within the span of a few months, is enough
              validation of his claim—this is not a flash in the pan.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Altman also likened the overall impact of AI (including AI Image
              Generators) to the introduction and popularization of cellular
              mobile phone usage in the 1990s (Reid &amp; Altman, 2022 Sep
              13)—which is too modest of a comparison. The AI Text-to-Image
              revolution should rather be compared to that of the global
              explosion of the Internet from the 1990s onward.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Finally, in discussing the future of AI tools, Altman sees
              “massive leaps forward” in at least two areas for improvement in
              general AI capabilities, both of which will clearly fuel more
              advances in AI Image Platforms: (1) in large language models, and
              (2) in “multimodal models that move between image and language.”
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Large language models, such as OpenAI’s GPT family, are crucial
              because they allow millions of Internet users (many of them with
              no familiarity with the likes of Adobe software) to use natural
              language, almost to loosely chat with the GPT and, based on that
              interaction, to give iterative instructions or suggestions to the
              AI image platform, causing it to generate amazing arrays of images
              and variations of images. The resounding success of platforms such
              as MidJourney, Dall-E, and Stable Diffusion, all rely on these
              large language models (Reid &amp; Altman, 2022 Sep 13).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              For Altman, Language models in the near future will use better and
              better algorithms, even potentially to the point where its AI
              capabilities may even outrun the availability of fresh data and
              higher computational power (Reid &amp; Altman, 2022 Sep 13).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              For the concept of multimodal models, Altman also foresees AI
              models with the capacity to shift more seamlessly from one
              multimedia mode to another. “We will get true multimodal models
              working—not just text and images but every modality you have in
              one model is able to easily fluidly move between things” (Reid
              &amp; Altman, 2022 Sep 13). In fact, developers in the field of 3D
              Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (3D AR/VR)—now often called
              Extended Reality or XR—are already seeing the arrival of AI
              components packaged as “autonomous smart agents” (virtual humans
              or humanized objects) in the round, with which we humans can
              interact not just via text and images, but via speech, facial and
              bodily gestures, and other modalities.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              As early as during the SIGGRAPH Asia workshop in 2017, the
              question was already posed and discussed: "what would happen when
              artificial worlds start to think, and how we humans can interact
              and communicate with AI through e.g. affective interfaces?"
              (Lugmayr et al., 2017).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              By 2021, a systematic review of recent tech literature revealed
              that “36 published records containing AI-XR combinations”
              indicated the use of such specific combinations in medical and
              surgical training, autonomous vehicles and robotics, military
              applications, gaming environments, and entertainment (Reiners et
              al., 2021).

              four well-known technologies that revolutionized the way we as
              human societies record, represent, and enrich our lives through
              visual media that we value for its cultural-aesthetic as well as
              functional-artisan content and form.

              These are (a) photography, (b) cinema/video, (c) basic digital
              image/video processing, and (d) online/interactive multimedia. In
              each case, the core of these technologies were clearly disruptive
              innovations in what we can now collectively refer to as “creative
              industries”. They were disruptive, not just in reshaping the
              creative businesses and professions whose careers and incomes
              derived from these fields, but also in reshaping the general
              public’s artistic and consumer habits and tastes. As we step on
              the threshold of the AI-art era, it is instructive to review these
              earlier technologies.

              Photography.
            </span>
            <span>
              Before photography, the dominant fields of visual media were
              painting, sculpture, and related arts and crafts, which included
              engraving, lithography, and more recent printing processes.
              Photography, at first a curiosity practiced by early 19th-century
              nerds, soon created its own industrial behemoths and
              artistic/consumer products and tastes. As photography became more
              accessible, especially in tandem with the print industries, its
              associated products, professions, and businesses eventually
              replaced (or marginalized, or pushed into specialized niches) the
              formerly more prominent types of visual arts and crafts. Once
              color photography tied up with glossy high-quality printing
              processes, the works of the masters–from Mesopotamia to the Mona
              Lisa to Mondrian–were almost as enjoyable to the ordinary public
              as to Louvre tourists.

              Cinema and video

            <span>
              . Before long, photography branched off into film/cinema, then
              video. This new set of technological innovations created yet
              previously unheard-of artistic/consumer products and tastes, and
              newer professions and business behemoths that catered to the
              demand. Again, as cinema and video became part of powerful mass
              media, they replaced (or marginalized, subsumed, or tied up with)
              such similar but older modes of cultural expression as theater,
              concerts, and other live spectacles (e.g. circuses, traveling
              shows). Hollywood, a sleepy outback town in the early 20th
              century, came to represent the global power of cinema and the
              cultures and lifestyles it represented.

              One result, as most of us know by now, is that photography and
              videography are no longer the exclusive turfs of highly trained
              professionals with specialized gear, but a common arena of
              creativity where anyone with a decent cellphone camera and editing

              historically connected enough to expect a fifth giant leap to
              generate similar impacts in the creative industries, in the
              general public’s consumer-artistic tastes and habits, and indeed,
              in the value assigned by entire societies to artistic work in

            <span>
              As we tried above to retrace the interaction of technology and
              art, we now realize more fully that the human artistic creative
              process is both intimately personal and deeply social in
              character. Artists don’t live isolated in ivory towers or
              insulated in a vacuum, but as part of the wider society where they
              are affected by the multi-faceted impacts of technology,
              economics, politics, and culture.

            <br />
            <span>
              There is some basis for the growing concern that AI-driven art
              tools will destroy the personal touch and the artists’ work as
              individuals (which was, by the way, a value enshrined by the
              Renaissance but not in prior eras). There is indeed the risk that
              these AI tools would turn the creative process into a big profit
              machine controlled by big business (which in many fields today it
              already is, anyway). But there are also the new potentials of the
              same creative process becoming more socialized if not
              collectivized in character, while small innovative groups and
              individuals use the same AI tools to remain independent and
              competitive.

            <span>
              Generally, technology (especially modern information technology)
              empowers society to maximize its many modes of communication and
              self-expression. Society’s creative output is thereby increased
              multiple times. Formerly elitist art becomes an arena that more
              people can engage in, enjoy, and share. Anyone with access to AI
              tools today can become an “instant artist” – in much the same way
              that 10-20 years ago, anyone with access to a digital camera could
              become an “instant photographer/videographer.” (Also, in roughly
              similar positions, did the early photographers become “instant
              painters”, to the chagrin of professionally acclaimed painters.)

              if not fully resolved. These include violations of intellectual
              property rights (IPR), of rules against plagiarism, and laws and
              ethical standards on pornography and identity forgery as these are
              currently defined and widely observed.

              As seen in our review of past innovations, the growth in art
              production fuelled similar growth in its economic aspects:

            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              • more people (with varied skills) and businesses (of varying
              size) engage in art production for their incomes or profit;

            <br />
            <span>
              • more art-laden products turn into commodities and command their
              own prices, reflecting high demand;
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              • businesses engaged in art production and distribution (what we
              now call the creative industries) proliferate to respond to the
              fast-growing demand;
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              • consumer-artistic habits and tastes are influenced by the new
              products, even reshaped drastically by the success of certain
              creative works (especially when pushed by dominant cultural forces
              and corporate advertising).
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              In other words, value chains grow and become more elaborate within
              the main creative industries and in related professions, if only
              because art production becomes more sophisticated, and now
              involves more technology and collective/collaborative work. Just
              think how many in-house art production crews and outsourced art
              services are involved in the production of a single Marvel or DC
              blockbuster.

              Reid and Altman (2022, Sept 13) explored the probable
              restructuring of industries impacted by AI as a whole,
              particularly in the use of AI models and platforms:
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              • There will be “a small handful of fundamental large [AI] models”
              that will allow APIs to be built on top of them.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              • There will be a middle layer of startup AI-based companies that
              don’t need to “reinvent the wheel” (i.e., develop and train their
              own AI models) but use these existing APIs to create specialized
              versions of the same AI models to create new products and services
              of long-lasting value.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              • Altman believes that small startups should leverage the
              advantage of low costs and fast cycle times. "And if you have
              those, you can then compete as a startup against the big
              incumbents."

            <span>
              There is often a tendency to equate the entirety of visual arts
              with (or have it represented by) the more aesthetic disciplines or
              genre (aka “fine arts”), as taught in art school, subjected to
              critical reviews, displayed in galleries, or at least created
              based on some high artistic standards and therefore expected to
              command a higher price for its intrinsic value.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              The other branches are often forgotten or deemed marginal. I.e.,
              “I’m an artist, you’re in layout design, s/he’s just an effin’
              Photoshop/Autocad implementor or grunt for an animation scene.”

            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              But let’s constantly remind ourselves that, throughout history,
              art has never really been separable from crafts (the production of
              materially useful goods and services), which in turn require
              certain degrees of personal and team skills—the result of which is
              that much of the visual arts created by society are not displayed
              in museums and galleries, not viewed in theaters and sold at
              auctions, but are embedded in other mundane things that we use
              every day: buildings (via architecture), appliances, furniture and
              wearables (via industrial and fashion design), books and magazines
              (layout), etc.

              huge global public with the help of digital visualization tools.
              AI is increasingly used to automate these otherwise tedious and
              error-prone archival/restoration processes. Examples that are
              clear in our chosen topic of AI-generated art are
              enhancement/restoration and colorization of old photographic
              images and films.

              Even in the natural and social sciences, the role of such
              practical applications of the digital art technology is
              increasingly recognized, e.g., the rapid growth of data
              visualization and computerized simulation/reconstruction and
              model-making (in biochemistry, physics including astrophysics,
              medicine, anthropology, archeology, legal forensics, etc). All
              these are being created, not just by data scientists and computer
              geeks, but by a new generation of scientists/technicians trained
              in data visualization, which is fast developing its own principles
              of digital aesthetics and AI-friendly methods.And we haven’t even
              begun to speak yet of still more branches of digital technology
              that provide increasingly smarter tools not just for visualization
              on computer screens and printouts, but physical/virtual
              interaction in full 3D. Ultra-realistic video games in 3D AR/VR
              environments are becoming useful tools in education, training, and
              research. 3D printing has its own explosive growth both for the
              supply side and the demand side. And in the reverse direction,
              which some theorists think will also become increasingly
              important, we humans will soon be conversing and creatively
              collaborating with AI “smart agents” via such 3D AR/VR
              environments – for example, in designing a home, doing a virtual
              3D “walkthrough”, and giving instructions to our AI Archi-designer
              helper to “move this post a bit to the right, have smaller windows
              on the left, and so on.”The purpose of pointing these out, we
              think, is to further emphasize that the technological revolution
              brought by AI in visual arts is not limited to very specific (and
              easily recognized) fields where a visual work can stand alone as
              art, but in so many products, services, and processes where the
              role of the visual-creative aspect is embedded and hidden. AI art
              technology may thus be seen as a very generalized tool with so
              many potential applications that for now are still unknown or just
              being discovered. These potential innovations and uses will
              certainly create new generations of “disruptor” startups in the
              creative industries (which are themselves already exploding).
              These disruptors could well mostly be small indie groups and
              individuals, but also possibly renegade innovators working quietly
              within the established giants.
