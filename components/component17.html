        1. AI Improves/Changes Artistsâ€™ workflowArtificial Intelligence helps
        lessen the time needed to produce work and is especially useful when an
        artist is bound by a time crunch (AI Art Shop, 2022). With AI Image
        Generators, it only takes a few parameters to have an
        artificially-engineered piece whose components, symmetry, and accuracy
        are dependent on how detailed the prompt is. The breakthrough of this
        technology and its introduction to the public offers a new look and new
        approach for the creative industry to try out. In a November 2022
        article by California State University, a Bachelor of Fine Arts student
        shared how they were able to come up with a painting using a series of
        AI-generated artworks for brainstorming and as references.
