        Artificial Intelligence helps lessen the time needed to produce work and
        is especially useful when an artist is bound by a time crunch (AI Art
        Shop, 2022). With AI Image Generators, it only takes a few parameters to
        have an artificially-engineered piece whose components, symmetry, and
        accuracy are dependent on how detailed the prompt is.

        references.
