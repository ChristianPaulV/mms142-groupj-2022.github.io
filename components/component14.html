        For some people, pursuing art is a life calling. They cannot simply
        detach themselves from it for the sake of practicality.

        Treading this creative path can exhaust one’s resources because
        opportunities and materials that can help improve and nurture artistic
        skills tend to be expensive. And this is where AI can be truly helpful
        in furthering aspiring artists’ learning competencies. One only needs to
        have access to the internet and a decent understanding of how the new
        technology works to explore different art styles and mediums that they
        most resonate with.
