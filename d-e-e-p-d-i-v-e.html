                  Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI. It consists of
                  algorithms that execute intelligent tasks by learning directly
                  from data instead of following rules that are pre-programmed
                  by a human developer (Tiwari et al., 2018).

                <span>
                  In traditional programming, human developers would code
                  explicit step-by-step rules that tell a computer program how
                  to do something. In ML, the computer program will instead be
                  given tasks, then it will analyze large amounts of data
                  (datasets)—provided by human developers—to find patterns or
                  examples of how its assigned tasks can be accomplished. Over
                  time, this process also referred to as “training,” allows the
                  computer program to learn the best way to achieve its goal
                  (Tiwari et al., 2018).

                  Machine learning allows knowledge to be extracted from data.
                  Going into more detail, “finding patterns or examples” or
                  “training” means that machine learning algorithms (in computer
                  programs) would classify pieces of data either into

                  These features or categories will help the algorithm extract
                  knowledge and reach its desired outcome (Tiwari et al.,2018;

                  Supervised learning is used for machine learning tasks that
                  require precise outputs. For example, a machine learning
                  algorithm can predict when a plane is about to leave an
                  airport, by being trained on a human-written dataset. The said
                  dataset can include information about peak hours at the
                  airport and weather types that can affect flight conditions
                  (Alteryx, n.d.).

                  Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is mostly used for
                  generative AI. (Alteryx, n.d.).

                    AI as a whole has been very pervasive for the last six
                    decades, especially machine learning. Currently, machine
                    learning models can be found in major technological systems
                    worldwide and their corresponding industries (Brighterion,

                              uses Artificial Neural Network technology to

                        As shown in the table, although deep learning acts as an
                        extension of ML, it still suffers from limitations that
                        restrict its applications in other industries. Aside
                        from longer training time and expensive hardware
                        requirements, the most evident limitation is deep
                        learning’s incapability to explain its decision-making
                        process in a way that a human can understand (Tiwari et
                        al., 2018). This lack of interpretability disqualifies
                        it for industries that require precise results
                        (Brighterion, 2017).

                      Another issue is regarding the datasets that DL algorithms
                      require for training. The fact that DL algorithms can
                      accept datasets comprising only raw data and no human
                      intervention is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand,
                      it can learn independently but on the other hand,
                      introducing changes in an element from its dataset can
                      return incorrect results (Brighterion, 2017).

                  Still, without deep learning, AI Image Generation would not
                  have been possible. Furthermore, the table above infers that
                  traditional machine learning techniques are very limited in
                  terms of data processing. Traditional ML can only process
                  information that is hand-coded and cannot understand raw data
                  (e.g., pixel values or the English language) (Tiwari et al.,

                  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a topic in artificial
                  intelligence that focuses on machines or algorithms that are
                  designed to understand natural language as voice or text data.
                  “Understanding” in NLP is more than just knowledge of the
                  word’s meaning but it also includes understanding elements
                  such as the mood and intent of the speaker, even sarcasm (IBM
                  Cloud Education, 2020b).

                  There are various ways to achieve NLP. For generative AI, NLP
                  requires a combination of deep learning algorithms and a
                  “rule-based model of human language,” referred to as
                  computational linguistics. Together, DL algorithms and
                  computational linguistics can mimic how the human mind
                  understands the arbitrariness of natural languages through
                  both written and spoken words (IBM Cloud Education, 2020b).

                  The field of Artificial Intelligence was born in 1956 when
                  computer scientists and mathematicians held a six-week
                  research workshop at Dartmouth College regarding “machines
                  that can think” (Moor, 2006). 9 years after, an algorithm
                  similar to the idea of deep learning was introduced by
                  mathematicians Ivakhnenko and Lapa to analyze algebraic
                  concepts (Tiwari et al., 2018).

                  DL algorithms were able to automatically label images and with
                  the help of NLP, output those labels as natural languages—in
                  simpler terms, provide images with automatic English captions.
                  This image-to-text technology was reversed the following year
                  to generate entirely new images just from a few words

                            exactly know what makes a banana or what an apple
                            is.

                            model is given a dataset with a specific label that
                            consists of a picture of a banana with an image

                      The generative model does not only know that a banana is
                      yellow, but it also knows its shape, texture, other
                      incomprehensible characteristics such as “

                      ,” and the relationship of Bananas with other concepts.
                      Therefore, if the generative model truly knows “what makes
                      a banana” from an image with a caption, then it follows
                      that it can recreate an entirely new image of a banana.

                                Image Generator called DALL-E in January 2021
                                and its upgrade, DALL-E 2, the following year.
                                OpenAI claims that DALL-E 2 can “create
                                realistic images and art from a description in
                                natural language” (DALL-E 2, n.d.).

                                Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs. Since
                                GANs and transformer-based models have the same
                                output—in this context as AI-generated
                                images—GANs would no longer be discussed in this
                                guide (Generative AI Models, 2022).

                                Prior to deep learning, DALL-E first requires a
                                gargantuan and diverse dataset for training.
                                OpenAI solves this problem by collecting
                                hundreds of millions of alt text and their
                                corresponding images all over the Web. Alt text
                                refers to text descriptions that people add when
                                uploading images on the web for the purpose of
                                web accessibility and allowing it to be easily
                                organized by search engines (i.e., search engine
                                indexation). With this, OpenAI was able to
                                satisfy the requirements of DALL-E without
                                having the need to manually tag images with
                                captions and create hand-coded rules, hence a
                                dataset with very minimal labels (limited
                                supervised learning) (Vox, 2022a).

                                DALL-E then proceeds to feed on its massive

                                generate images. The transformer-based model can
                                generally be separated into two parts: encoder
                                and decoder (Generative AI Models, 2022).

                          The encoder is what feeds onto the input/dataset
                          (Generative AI Models, 2022). It tries to extract all
                          the features present in an image and its corresponding
                          text description, and convert them into meaningful
                          categories to pass to the decoder.

                          What the “extract all the features” and “convert them
                          into meaningful categories” actually mean is that the
                          encoder determines “features” of the image (as pixel
                          values) and converts them as vectors or “meaningful
                          categories” to separate them from one another in a
                          mathematical space—this concept is known as latent
                          space (Vox, 2022a). Then using these categories, the
                          encoder matches the images to their text descriptions
                          a thousand times until it figures out a method that is
                          “good enough”—this is what is referred to as deep
                          learning (Generative AI Models, 2022); see also (Vox,
                          2022a).

                          DALL-E is not only required to understand what makes a
                          banana but it is also tasked to determine what makes
                          other things and how are they different or similar
                          from bananas. In other words, generative AI models, in
                          general, do not only define what an object is but also
                          define its relationship with other objects.

                      In reality, DALL-E creates at least 500 categories for
                      each feature (Vox, 2022a), it follows that humans do not
                      have all the words to describe these, resulting in
                      incomprehensible regions of information like “banana-ness”
                      amongst many, many other things.

                    <span>
                      Once the encoder creates the meaningful categories, the
                      decoder “receives” them to create an output of generated
                      novel images. The decoder achieves this through the use of
                      a mechanism called Diffusion that “picks” a mathematical
                      point/value in the latent space, then translates it to an
                      image pixel. The combination of image pixels first starts
                      out as noise and then eventually becomes a “proper” image
                      after a series of iterations (Generative AI Models, 2022;
                      see also Vox, 2022a).

                    Because of the randomness of diffusion, it will never return
